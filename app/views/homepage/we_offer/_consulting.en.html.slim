  We advise you on all sorts of accessibility issues, in particular:

  - [WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) sowie [2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
  - [ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
  - [BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/mobile)

  We are happy to provide information on everyday questions that arise in most projects, for example:

  - When should accessibility be considered in a project?
  - What has to be considered with the visual layout?
  - Which third-party code libraries (widgets, templates) are accessible?
  - Is there a "compromise" that leads to respectable accessibility with little effort?
